# CognitiveControlAndRewardLearning
This project is about implementing computational models of Cognitive Control and Reward Learning and fitting the models to the behavioral data of Control Group and patients with Parkinson disease. Furthermore, we are going to analysis the interrelation between biological metrics extracted from EEG signals and metrics in the computational models.
